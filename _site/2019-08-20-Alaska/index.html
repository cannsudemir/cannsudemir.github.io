<p>This was my first field trip of my PhD research which is still ongoing. We have stayed in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kaktovik,+AK/@70.130693,-143.6608197,5268m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5118b4c239616e05:0x42a95e4c23c04751!8m2!3d70.1319444!4d-143.6238889">Kaktovik, Alaska</a> (a small village at the northern coast of Alaska, within the ANWR region) for 9 days. But we could only do 3-4 days of fieldwork because of the whether and logistical issues.</p>

<p>It is the greatest experience of my life ! Can’t wait to go back there !</p>

<h2 id="why-are-we-doing-research-here">Why are we doing research here?</h2>

<p>I am interested in learning about the groundwater in coastal permafrost regions where we expect to have a great complexity in physical processes due to ice formation/melting, oceanic forces, unique landscape.</p>

<p>Permafrost is a soil that is below 0ˆOC consecutively for 2 years. The water within the soil spaces can be frozen or stay unfrozen depending on the composition. Groundwater that flow through unfrozen spaces in the soil carries organic matter and heat. Here is the important point ! Let’s see why:</p>

<p>Permafrost has been storing organic carbon for thousands of years which was not accessible to microorganisms before. As it thaws, they are mobilized and can be biologically degraded. What this means is that MORE CO2, MORE CH4 and MORE WARMING!</p>

<p>Groundwater, a product of thawing due to climate warming, plays an important role at this point in terms of making the matter accessible to microbes and affecting the thermodynamics of the system which might cause more thawing. It can affect the whole coastal ecosystem.</p>

<p>The two pictures above and below show how serious the thawing and coastal degradation at Barter Island is. When there is no ice to hold the soil structure anymore, it collapses as it is seen here.</p>

<p>We observed the groundwater discharge as a surface runoff at the coast of Barter Island as it might be seen in the below picture.</p>

<p>We drove a boat to our field site everyday to the other side of Kaktovik Lagoon. It takes about 15 minutes to get there. We went out there whenever the winds slowed down. Almost every time we came back to the island, polar bears greeted us on the land and sometimes scared us in the water :)</p>

<p>We did a great job as a team !</p>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>We brought 6 big luggage with us ! Each were minimum 50 pounds. A lot of equipment from piezometers to post drivers, sampling kits, sensors, chemistry items, coring equipments, auger kit and A LOT OF COLORFUL ELECTRIC TAPES ! :)</p>

<h2 id="water-sampling">Water Sampling</h2>

<p>The first thing to do was to set a piezometer (tiny PVC wells) transect. Then using a pump and a hose, we measured for groundwater conductivity, temperature and pH. Also collected water samples to measure for specific dissolved components and isotopes.</p>

<p>We had a little chemistry setup at home where we prepared our samples for storage.</p>

<p>Finally, our house was very cozy :D One morning, the house door was completely open and no one touched it. Polar bears were coming to town and looking for food around houses. We might have had a late night guest in our house, who knows :)</p>
