<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong></p>

<p>GuÃàzelyurt, coastal aquifer, which is an unconfined, is the most important, at the same
time the largest drinking, municipal, and irrigational water resource in Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC). However, the aquifer has exceeded its safe
yield capacity due to excessive and uncontrolled pumping over the years and the
water quality has been seriously degraded due to seawater intrusion.</p>

<p><img src="/images/TRNC.png" alt="Co1" /></p>

<p>The ‚ÄúTRNC Water Supply Project‚Äù, completed in June 2016, annually supplies about 75 MCM
of water via pipeline under Mediterranean Sea from Alak√∂pruÃà Dam in Anamur by
Turkish Republic to solve the water shortage problem in TRNC. About 38
MCM/year of water out of the total transfer has been allocated to domestic water
demand. The remaining 37 MCM/year planned to be used for irrigation can
potentially be used to artificially recharge the aquifer and in turn, the deteriorated
water budget of the aquifer can be reestablished in the mid- and long-term.</p>

<p>The objective of this study is to predict the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer under
predefined stress and recharge scenarios regarding the water usage. For this purpose,
the 3-D detailed conceptual and numerical simulation models of GuÃàzelyurt Aquifer
have been developed using system modeling approach integrated with today‚Äôs
modern technologies of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and numerical
simulation techniques. The available geologic, hydrologic and hydrogeological data
provided by Geology and Mining Department (G&amp;MD) of TRNC and collected from
previously published field reports have been used in model development process.
The developed numerical model has been first calibrated under steady-state and
transient conditions.</p>

<p>The calibrated model has been then run for simulations of three
different scenarios involving rehabilitation of the deteriorated water balance of the
aquifer. In the initial scenario, the aquifer has been simulated under the conditions of
no pumping for irrigation. In the second and the last scenarios, in addition to no-pumping
conditions of the first scenario, 28 MCM/year of the water from the project
was artificially fed to the aquifer from the GuÃàzelyurt Dam and the Dam and injection
wells combined, respectively. In all three scenarios, the depression zone has
disappeared and the ‚Äúzero‚Äù head contour has approximated to the coast after average
of 12 years, in all three cases. Moreover, it has been found that at least 76% of the
water allocated for irrigation should be used for artificial recharge to obtain an
effective aquifer recovery. However, although more than half of the water coming
for irrigation is used for this purpose, the aquifer has not returned to its natural
conditions in the near future based on the simulated years. The earliest natural state was achieved in 48 years by the recharge method with the combination of injection
wells and dam. Therefore, this option has been the most effective method.</p>
