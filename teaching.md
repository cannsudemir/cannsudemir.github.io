**I assisted 2 UT courses during my PhD in the Department of Geosciences:**

*2) Groundwater Hydrology*



**During my Master's in Environmental Engineering department at METU, I assisted 5 different courses covering a wide range of topics in Environmental Science and Management.**

*1) Environmental Engineering Modeling*

*2) Transport Processes in Environmental Engineering*

*3) Unit Operations and Processes of Water Treatment*

*4) Environmental Microbiology Laboratory*

*5) Environmental Management*


**Teaching Geology to K-12 students**

Teaching kindergarten age kids is where you really experience what teaching is. Their curiosity inspires me. I was very lucky that in 2019 and 2022, I got to experience teaching kindergarten students at Kikker Elementary School in Austin.
